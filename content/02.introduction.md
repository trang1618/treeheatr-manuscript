## Introduction

Tree-based algorithms such as random forests and gradient boosted trees are widely used techniques that comprise an important section of supervised machine learning.
Visualizing and intepreting their building blocks, the single decision trees, are the first steps toward understanding these complex tree-based structures.
However, it is difficult to incorporate the tree's predictive performance and the feature space in a single visualization.
Existing software frequently treats all nodes in a decision tree similarly, leaving limited options for improving information presentation at the leaf nodes.
Specifically, state-of-the-art libraries such as Python's [dtreeviz](https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz), while producing aesthetic trees with detailed histograms at inner nodes, draw pie chart at leaf nodes.
The *ggparty* R package allows the user to have full control of the representation of each node but fixes the leaf node widths, which can limit the ability to show more collective visualizations.

We have developed the *treeheatr* package to utilize the leaf node space to show the data as a heatmap where the samples and features are optionally clustered to improve interpretation.
After simple installation, the user can apply *treeheatr* on their classification or regression problem with a single function:
```r
heat_tree(data, task = 'classification', target_lab = 'Outcome')
```
This one line of code above will generate the conditional inference tree, perform clustering, and produce a decision tree-heatmap as a *ggplot* object that can be viewed in RStudio's viewer pane, saved to a graphic file, or embedded in an RMarkdown document.
This example assumes a classification problem, but one can also apply *treeheatr* on a regression problem by changing the `task` argument.

This article is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we show an example *treeheatr* application by employing its functions on a real-world clinical dataset from a study of diabetes mellitus in a high risk population of Pima Indians [@pmcid:PMC2245318].
In Section 3, we describe in detail the important functions and corresponding arguments in *treeheatr*.
We demonstrate the flexibility the user has in tweaking these arguments to enhance understanding of the tree-based models applied on their dataset.
Finally, we discuss general guidelines for creating effective decision tree-heatmap visualization.
