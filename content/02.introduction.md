## Introduction

Tree-based algorithms such as random forests and gradient boosted trees are widely used techniques that comprise an important section of supervised machine learning.
Decision trees are primitive constituents of many important  including .
Visualizing and intepreting their building blocks, the single decision trees, are the first steps toward understanding these more complex tree-based structures.
Nonetheless, existing visualization softwares frequently treat all nodes similarly, leaving limited options for improving visualization at the leaf nodes.
Currently, at leaf nodes, state-of-the-art libraries such as Python's [dtreeviz](https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz) draw pie charts.

In a visualization, it is difficult to find the sweet spot on the spectrum from enhancing understanding to overloading information. 

an opportunity for the data to be shown at the leaf nodes as a heatmap.

heatmap: complimentary of histogram at non-leaf nodes.
correlation: implied from clustering
