## A simple example

This example visualizes the conditional inference tree model built to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes from a dataset provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [@pmcid:PMC2245318].
This dataset of 768 female patients at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage near Phoenix, Arizona was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) and has eight features: age, number of pregnancies, plasma glucose concentration, diastolic blood pressure, skin fold thickness, 2-hour serum insulin, body mass index (BMI) and diabetes pedigree function.
Detailed descriptions of these variables and data source can be found on the Kaggle page.

The following lines of code computes and visualizes the conditional decision tree along with the heatmap containing features that are important for building this model (Fig. @fig:example):

```
heat_tree(
  data = diabetes,
  target_lab = 'Diabetes status',
  label_map = c(`0` = 'Negative', `1` = 'Positive')
)
```

The `heat_tree()` function takes a data frame, a character string indicating the column name associated with the outcome/phenotype (e.g., Diabetes status) and other optional arguments such as the mapping of the outcome label.

In this example, we observe that glucose level is the first determining factors in predicting diabetes status.
When this value is above 127 but not larger than 154 (observations with light green glucose value), BMI helps further distinguish the group with diabetes from the other.
On the left branches, while these samples are predicted to not have diabetes by majority voting, the leaf nodes have different purity.
These seemingly non-beneficial splits present an opportunity to teach machine learning novices the different measures of node impurity such as the Gini index or cross-entropy [@isbn:978-0387848570].
General patterns in the heatmap for this example can be difficult to parse because of the large number of observations, but we can still observe similar color patterns between age and the number of pregnancies indicating a correlation between these two features, which is expected.
