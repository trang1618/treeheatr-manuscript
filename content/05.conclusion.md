In this paper, we presented the new type of integrated visualization of decision trees and heatmaps, which provides a comprehensive data overview as well as model interpretation.

The visualization is implemented in an easily installed package with a detailed vignette.
Released as open source software, {treeheatr} hopes to receive contribution from other developers.

Future works on *treeheatr* include enhancements such as supporting heatmap visualization of a holdout set and highlighting the tree branches that point to a specific holdout sample.
