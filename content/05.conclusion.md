## Conclusion

In this paper, we presented the new type of integrated visualization of decision trees and heatmaps, which provides a comprehensive data overview as well as model interpretation.
We demonstrated that this integration uncovers meaningful patterns among the predictive features and highlights the important elements of conditional trees including feature splits and several leaf node characteristics such as prediction value, impurity and number of leaf samples.
Implemented in an easily installed package with a detailed vignette, *treeheatr* can be a useful teaching tool to enhance students' understanding of this fundamental model before diving into more complex tree-based machine learning methods.
This package has been released as open source software expected to receive contribution from other developers.

Future works on *treeheatr* include enhancements such as supporting heatmap visualization of a holdout set and highlighting the tree branches that point to a specific holdout sample.
Simple data preprocess beyond scaling and normalizing the features may be beneficial for handling outliers and missing data points, which might result in more robust models and informative visualizations.
