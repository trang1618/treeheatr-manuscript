## Abstract {.page_break_before}

### Summary
*treeheatr* is an R package for creating interpretable decision tree visualizations with the data represented as heatmaps at the tree's leaf nodes.
The integrated presentation of the tree structure along with an overview of the data efficiently illustrates how the tree nodes split up the feature space and how well the tree model performs.
This visualization can also be examined in depth to uncover the correlation structure in the data and importance of each feature in predicting the outcome.
Implemented in an easily installed package with a detailed vignette, *treeheatr* can be a useful teaching tool to enhance students' understanding of a simple decision tree model before diving into more complex tree-based machine learning methods.

### Availability and implementation
The *treeheatr* package is freely available under the permissive [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) at <https://trang1618.github.io/treeheatr> and <https://cran.r-project.org/package=treeheatr>.
It comes with a [detailed vignette](https://trang1618.github.io/treeheatr/articles/explore.html) that is automatically built with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) continuous integration.
