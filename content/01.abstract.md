## Abstract {.page_break_before}

### Summary
*treeheatr* is an R package for creating interpretable decision tree visualizations with the data represented as heatmaps at the tree's terminal nodes.
Going beyond the if-then step-by-step logic of a decision tree, the inclusion of a heatmap offers a broader view of the classification or regression problem and provides meaningful clarification of different node splits in the tree.
Working harmoniously with other packages, *treeheatr* empowers the user with refined controls over the statistical threshold and presentation of the tree and heatmap.

### Availability and implementation
The *treeheatr* package is freely available under the permissive [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) at <https://trang1618.github.io/treeheatr>.
It comes with a detailed vignette that is automatically built with continuous integration.
